### redux-webauthn client-side example

A demo showing *only* the client-side creation of a credential keypair (when registering a user), and using that credential to authenticate a user. 

*Important Note: This example does not show the full server-client communication pattern required for authenticating a user with the Web Authentication API. For a full example, see the redux-webauthn demo in the main repo.*

To run:

```
yarn
yarn start
```
